The bourbon was bottled at 90 proof and is exactly 10 years, 11 months old. • The whiskey spent the majority of its life in Buffalo Trace's special Single (Single) Barrel Warehouse V but the final year was spent in a separate warehouse. The distillery constructed Warehouse V back in 1953 to house its 2 millionth barrel. Every millionth barrel thereafter has been aged in that location.
